# Evolutionary Architecture

## Objective

### Problem

### Proposed Solution

## Domain

### Overview
The chosen domain for analysis and implementation is the _Fitness Studio_. It is an area that most of people have an idea of how it works. You can:

- Get an offer
- Request for a contract
- Sign the contract
- Receive a pass (to be able to enter the fitness studio)
- Attend to fitness classes

and any more.

However, in order to identify the above processes, you usually need to analyse the domain with _Domain Experts_ and break it down into smaller pieces called _Subdomains_. Otherwise, there is a high risk of falling into a big ball of mud where everything is tightly coupled.

At first glance, the domain seems small. And problems of oversimplification of initial assumptions usually arise from this interpretation. There are dozens of processes related to expired passes and renewals, discount policies, VIP access, negative cases (e.g. rejection of the access). We often tend to underestimate the problem.

IMPORTANT: Remember that what we want to show you in this repository is how to handle a domain split into a few example subdomains, and how to prepare building blocks that will allow you to easily extend them to cover all processes. We are not able to cover the entire _Fitness Studio_ domain, as that would probably take us a year (or more) of work. **Do not worry -  we try to show ideas here that are complex enough to be applied to your application.**

### Subdomains
Now, when you understand on what business domain do we focus, it is a time to split it into smaller pieces called _Subdomains_.

There are many ways to handle it. Our 3 favorites are:

- https://domainstorytelling.org[Domain Storytelling]
- https://www.eventstorming.com[Event Storming]
- https://storystorming.com[Story Storming]

In general, it is all about finding processes by discovering the flow. Based on different heuristics, you are able to define the smaller blocks.

After analysis round, we decided to choose following areas for the implementation to show you the idea of _Evolutionary Architecture_:

As you can imagine, each subdomain covers a lot of different processes. Again, due to a limited time we cannot focus on each and every aspect. That is why we selected following actions for each subdomain:

image::Assets/subdomains_processes.jpg[]

There are in total 6 different processes in 4 different subdomains. There is one problem here - these subdomains do not communicate with each other and this is one of the most common problems that we have in our applications. Therefore, we decided to complicate it a bit and add some communication:

There are 2 triggers:

- when contract is signed by you (a customer), then the new pass is registered to allow you to enter the fitness studio
- when contract is expired, then the new offer is prepared (that will be send to you as a customer)

This way we are almost ready to start the implementation.

One more thing to mention - in our example, each subdomain is going to be a separate _Bounded Context_.

IMPORTANT: It is worth to mention that there might be a situation where several subdomains will create one _Bounded Context_. We look deeper at it in chapter 4, where we introduce a domain model.
